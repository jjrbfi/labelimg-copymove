# LabelImg-CopyMove

### Basic usage:
**Copy**  **-c**  the annotation images and text file to another directory.
```bash
./labelimg_copymove.py -c my_annotations/ new_dest/
```
**Move**  **-m**  the annotation images and text file to another directory.
```bash
./labelimg_copymove.py -m my_annotations/ new_dest/
```
Actually it's configure for **.jpg** images.  If you wish you can change it in the code for **.png**, **.jpeg**, etc...
